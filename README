SafeBuckets
=======

Overrides the internal CraftBukkit BlockStationary to never make stationary
water/lava flow if a certain damage value is set and makes water/lava placed
from buckets use this damage value. This makes player-placed water/lava
never flow while still allowing normal water/lava to follow vanilla Minecraft
physics.
